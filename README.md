# Go To Sleep - Revengeance
A new bot based off of an old one that is so overcome with in-jokes that it's not worth putting out in the public. Get your friends some semblance of a decent sleep schedule.

## What you'll need if you want to run this yourself:

- The bot token of a Discord developer application with a bot account
- A Google Cloud Services API token with the Maps Geocoding and Time Zone APIs enabled
- A place to host it (I'm currently using a Microsoft Azure VM to varying degrees of success)
- Python 3 - tested on 3.6 - 3.8, but very well may work on higher versions
- These Python libraries:

    - [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
    - [Google Maps Python library](https://pypi.org/project/googlemaps/)
    - [ntplib](https://pypi.org/project/ntplib/)
    
- Patience of a saint
